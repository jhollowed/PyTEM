Remap matrices will be saved to this location after generation as NetCDF files. The spherical harmonic solver which builds these matrices searches the contents of this directory first before deciding to build a new matric from scratch. 

Files can also be manually added to this directory to avoid this computation if the remap matrix for a given paring of native grid, output grid, and choice of L is already possesed. Any such files should have been generated by this package, and should match the naming scheme:

zonalmean_map_[input grid name]_[output grid name]_[L].nc

For maps that deposit the zonal mean back onto the native grid, the input and output grid names should be the same.
