P0 = 101325     # surface pressure in Pa
R  = 287.058    # gas constant for dry air, J/K/kg
Cp = 1004.64    # specific heat for dry air at constant pressure in J/K/kg
g0 = 9.80665    # global average of gravity at mean sea level in m/s^2
a = 6.37123e6   # radius of Earth in m
Om = 7.29212e-5 # rotation rate of Earth in 1/s
k = R/Cp        # ratio of gas constant to specific heat, dimensionless
